You will need the libpng >= 1.2.x installed.                       -*- text -*-

The installation is standard make + make install:

	$ make
	$ make test	# optional
	$ su -c 'make install'

You may specify PREFIX in order to install somewhere else instead of
/usr/local, which is the default:

	$ make install PREFIX=$HOME

will install to your home directory.  This creates directory include/png++ and
copies all .hpp files from the package directory there.
